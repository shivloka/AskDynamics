DT automatically detects and lists web service calls, remote calls, all method calls, letting you identify what PPs called them. But the biggest difference is that with DT all the work is done by the server.  The agent does very little. (It doesnâ€™t even do the instrumentation at JVM startup; it merely captures loaded classes and sends them to another component that modifies the byte code and sends it back.)  Every request gets a PP (except those you choose to ignore, like *.jpg or *.css).  The server puts them all together, then analyzes them for response time and other metrics.  AppD agents do much more evaluation of requests, deciding when to take snapshots.  This architectural difference lets AppD scale to greater numbers of nodes.",
